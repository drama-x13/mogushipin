#Common Issues and Solutions in Java Code Review
Copy string multiple times

In Java, immutable objects like String do not require multiple copies. If you need to change the content of a String object, you should use StringBuffer. For example, some code may unnecessarily make multiple copies of a String object, which can lead to poor performance and complex code. The correct approach is to avoid unnecessary copying operations on immutable objects.

No cloned objects returned

In Java, returning a reference to private data can break encapsulation. For example, in some classes like the Example class, which guarantees that the height and width values it stores are always non-negative, if getValues() returns a reference to an internal object rather than a copy, external code could modify its internal state. The correct approach is to return a copy of the internal data object instead of a reference in such situations, ensuring the safety of the object's internal state.

Unnecessary Cloning

Although get methods should generally return a copy of the internal data object, for immutable objects like Integers, which can't be modified once created, it is safe to return the internal Integer object instead of its copy. Avoid unnecessary cloning operations on immutable objects.

Write your own code to copy arrays

Developers may mistakenly write code to copy arrays, such as using a loop to do what can be done in one line with the Object's clone method. The correct approach is to use more concise and efficient methods like the Object's clone method to copy arrays.

Copying incorrect data

Sometimes programmers know they have to return a copy but might accidentally copy the wrong data. For example, when cloning multidimensional arrays, they may end up only cloning the array itself and not the objects that the array contains, like when cloning an array of Dimension objects it clones the array but the caller can still change the contents of the array elements, the Dimension objects. The right thing to do is to deep copy all the data you need to protect.

Check if the result of the new operation is null

Java programming novices sometimes check if the result of new is null, which is unnecessary. Avoid this redundant check.

Common Issues and Solutions in PHP Function Code Review
Missing type hint

This can result in code that is difficult to understand and maintain. To solve this problem, you need to add proper type hints when writing PHP functions.

Missing Document Comments

Missing documentation comments affect code understanding and maintenance, so it's important to develop the habit of adding detailed documentation comments.

Flags not using the glob() function

Using glob() without the appropriate flags can lead to unexpected results; make sure to use the correct flags when working with this function.

Unhandled Exception

Unhandled exceptions can lead to uncaught errors; add exception handling mechanisms to your code.

Duplicate Code

Repeated code leads to redundancy and maintenance difficulties. It is necessary to optimize the code by removing duplicate parts.
